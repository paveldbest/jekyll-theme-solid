title: A Great First Post

First ever post on my git-hub page. Don't know this markdown language really well,
so the layout may looks awfull.


The PPL program has been exectued for about three weeks now and well I don't feel great 
everytime after my workout because I'm also on a cutting with a 500 calorie deficit(1890 cal).
The training  routine seems work fine but it's a huge transtion for me from training strength to 
aesthestics. From 5*5 to 3*8 or even 3*12. And to actually feel the muscle mind connection not 
just simply finish the rep. Will come back after maybe 2 weeks when Sem2 starts again, to evluate my 
progess again.

This is it!
